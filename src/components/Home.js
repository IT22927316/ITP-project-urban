                        <p>A green recovery could create 20 million jobs by 2030. There is an urgent need to prepare workers, employers and, more generally, businesses for the jobs of the future, including green jobs and investing in people is crucial. A new white paper from the Adecco Group shares key learnings from five projects focused on providing training for green jobs.</p>

                            <p>In the years since it was first published, the standard definition commonly used in reports that refer to the green economy has come from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which states that green jobs are: (a) jobs in businesses that produce environmentally friendly goods or services or conserve natural resources, or (b) jobs where workers are responsible for making their establishment's production processes more environmentally friendly or use fewer natural resources.

Almost all sectors and levels of the workforce will require green skills. There is a demand across all industries for green talent, according to LinkedIn's Global Green Skills Report 2022, but there are not enough workers with the skills to fill those positions.</p>

                            <p>In our recent paper, “Training for green jobs”, we illustrate five examples of green skills training-schemes.

As expected, the context is different in each country, and the training programmes vary in length and setup. The paper shares the most important findings, challenges and learnings from these five experiences, highlighting the significance of investing in talent for the green transition:
